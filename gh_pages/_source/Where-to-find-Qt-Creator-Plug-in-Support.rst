Where to find Qt Creator Plug-in Support
========================================

There are three reliable ways to get into contact:

#. There is the bug tracker on `bugreports.qt.io <https://bugreports.qt.io>`_. People here are very aware of everything entered there, but may not react immediately. But this is the best place for feature requests, bug reports and similar things that should not be forgotten.
#. Our mailing list is actively read by all developers. That is available  `here <http://lists.qt-project.org/mailman/listinfo/qt-creator>`_ which should get most questions answered.
#. The fastest option is IRC: #qt-creator on the freenode network. All developers hang out there, at least while they are in the office. So European business hours tend to work best.

.. Note:: This `link <https://wiki.qt.io/Maintainers>`_ provides a good overview of names to ping for specific questions.
